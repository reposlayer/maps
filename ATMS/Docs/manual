1. Project Structure

bash

crypto_atm/
│
├── .env
├── atm.log
├── solana_pay_server.py
└── templates/
    └── qr_code.html

2. Installation and Setup
Prerequisites

    Python 3.7 or higher
    pip (Python package installer)

Install Required Libraries

bash

pip install solana-py requests flask python-dotenv

3. Configuration

Create a .env file in the crypto_atm directory to store your environment variables. Replace the placeholder values with your actual keys and credentials.
.env

plaintext

FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your_flask_secret_key
ATM_PUBLIC_KEY=your_sol_wallet_public_key
ATM_SECRET_KEY=your_sol_wallet_secret_key

4. Running the Application

Navigate to the crypto_atm directory and run the Flask server:

bash

python solana_pay_server.py

The server will start on http://0.0.0.0:5000.
5. Endpoints
1. Generate QR Code

Endpoint: /generate_qr

Method: GET

Description: Generates a QR code for Solana Pay with the specified amount.

Parameters:

    amount (required): The amount of SOL to be paid.

Example:

bash

curl "http://localhost:5000/generate_qr?amount=0.1"

2. Check Payment

Endpoint: /check_payment

Method: POST

Description: Checks if the specified amount of SOL has been received.

Parameters (JSON body):

    amount (required): The amount of SOL to check for.

Example:

bash

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"amount": "0.1"}' "http://localhost:5000/check_payment"

3. Webhook

Endpoint: /webhook

Method: POST

Description: Receives webhook notifications (implementation can be customized based on use case).

Parameters (JSON body):

    Any JSON payload (based on your specific webhook implementation).

Example:

bash

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"event": "payment_received"}' "http://localhost:5000/webhook"

6. Error Handling and Logging

The application includes logging to track activities and errors. Logs are stored in atm.log:

    INFO: Logs successful operations such as QR code generation and payment receipt.
    ERROR: Logs any errors that occur during the execution of endpoints.

7. Environment Variables

Environment variables are used to securely manage sensitive data. Ensure the .env file is correctly set up with the following variables:

    FLASK_SECRET_KEY: Secret key for Flask application.
    ATM_PUBLIC_KEY: Public key of your Solana wallet.
    ATM_SECRET_KEY: Secret key of your Solana wallet.

8. Security Considerations

    Environment Variables: Store sensitive data in environment variables to avoid hardcoding them in your source code.
    HTTPS: Deploy your Flask app behind an HTTPS proxy to secure communication.
    Firewall: Restrict access to your server to only authorized IP addresses.
    Logging: Regularly monitor logs for any suspicious activities or errors.

9. Future Enhancements

    User Authentication: Integrate user authentication to restrict access to certain endpoints.
    Payment Confirmation: Implement a mechanism to confirm payment receipt, such as email or SMS notifications.
    Advanced Error Handling: Add more detailed error handling to cover more edge cases and provide better feedback.
    Performance Optimization: Optimize the server and database interactions for better performance under high load.
